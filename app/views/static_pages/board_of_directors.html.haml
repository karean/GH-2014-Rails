						%h1 Ari Hamilton
						%p Ari Hamilton is a graduate student at the London School of Economics, enrolled in the Urbanisation and Development Taught Masters program. He has been involved with Green Hope since it's first volunteer trip to Olgilai in the summer of 2012, and served as President of the non-profit following the 2013 through the 2014 trips. His experience with Green Hope drives his academic interest in development, and inspires his career aspirations to work in international development. For Ari, Green Hope not only offered an incredible introduction to an academic field, but an opportunity to implement best practices in partnership between nonprofits and local talent, and provide an otherwise absent quality education to the children of Olgilai.
